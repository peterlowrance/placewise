# Conventions


This will list out the additional formatting techniques used for the code that are not inherint to Typescript.

**NOTE: THIS FORMATTING HAS NOT BEEN FULLY APPLIED TO THE CODE YET.**  
This has just been implemented and will continue to be used this way from here on out.




## Comments



### General

If it takes longer than 5 seconds to figure out what something is or does, it should have a comment.


### Class Variable Declarations

Each will hyave a comment notating what it does. The comment will only have two spaces from the variable so that each according comment lines up with the variable, not each other in a big block.




## CSS Formatting



### General

Selectors will be sorted by thier alphabetical name.


### Grouping Related Formatting

When a CSS file is large, related selectors will be grouped under a category. The categories will be alphabetically sorted, and the inner selectors will be alphabatically sorted relative to each other.
